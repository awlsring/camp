# Local TODOs
Tracking items of things to implement.

## Short Term
* Define config structure and parsing
* Full migrate to zerolog
* Better main starting
* Power control
    * Track machines cababilities
    * Control implementation for machines (start, stop, reboot)
* Expire / flag stale machines (no heartbeat in period)
* Move go code under `internal` to libs under `packages`
